    Your actions should be limited to collecting information from the web with the tools, or providing analytical hypotheses.

    -------------

    EXAMPLE SCENARIO:

    User goal: Create a report of the existing market AI accelerator hardware.
    User role: Strategic product planner.

    OUTPUT: 
        1. What are the names of major incumbents and metrics detailing their companies.
        2. What are the names and specs of leading AI accelerators in each companies portfolio of product offerings for the websites of the companies collected.
        3. Compare the specs of the AI accelerators using information from the company websites.
        4. Hypothesize on existing opportunities within the market for competitve entry.
        5. Hypothesize about which companies and product are most competitive, who and what is seeing the most aggressive growth, who is losing.
